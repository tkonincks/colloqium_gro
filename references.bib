abstract = {We discuss the physical consequences of a duality between two models with quenched disorder, in which particles propagate in one dimension among random traps or across random barriers. We derive an exact relation between their diffusion fronts at fixed disorder, and deduce from this that their disorder-averaged diffusion fronts are exactly equal. We use effective dynamics schemes to isolate the different physical processes by which particles propagate in the models and discuss how the duality arises from a correspondence between the rates for these different processes.},

@article{Lang2012,
abstract = {We present a detailed derivation of a microscopic theory for the glass transition of a liquid enclosed between two parallel walls relying on a mode-coupling approximation. This geometry lacks translational invariance perpendicular to the walls, which implies that the density profile and the density-density correlation function depends explicitly on the distances to the walls. We discuss the residual symmetry properties in slab geometry and introduce a symmetry adapted complete set of two-point correlation functions. Since the currents naturally split into components parallel and perpendicular to the walls the mathematical structure of the theory differs from the established mode-coupling equations in bulk. We prove that the equations for the nonergodicity parameters still display a covariance property similar to bulk liquids.},
